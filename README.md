# Geometric algorithms course

This repository consists of solutions for geometric algorithms course at AGH UST. Every task is in a separate folder. Solutions were written in Jupyter Notebook using Python. Each folder contains task description and report in Polish. Notebook markdown cells are in Polish. Graphing tool was provided by course staff (that's why some of the code comments are in Polish 🙃), but it was modified by me to support more features. All cells are cleared. You can run them by yourself or just read the report.
