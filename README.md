# Geometric algorithms course

This repository consists of solutions for geometric algorithms course at AGH UST. Every task is in a separate folder. Solutions were written in Jupyter Notebook using Python. Each folder contains task description and report in Polish. Notebook markdown cells are in Polish. Graphing tool was provided by course staff (that's why some of the code comments are in Polish üôÉ), but it was modified by me to support more features. All cells are cleared. You can run them by yourself or just read the report.

## Tasks

- [lab 1](https://github.com/pklatka/geometric-algorithms-course/tree/main/Lab%201): testing what determinant is better for computations (numpy vs own implementation)
- [lab 2](https://github.com/pklatka/geometric-algorithms-course/tree/main/Lab%202): convex hull algorithms implementations (Graham and Jarvis algorithms)
- [lab 3](https://github.com/pklatka/geometric-algorithms-course/tree/main/Lab%203): monotone polygon triangulation algorithm implementation
- [lab 4](https://github.com/pklatka/geometric-algorithms-course/tree/main/Lab%204): sweep line algorithm implementation
- [final project](https://github.com/pklatka/visibility-graph): visibility graph
